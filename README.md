# Capture the Flag Server (Praktikum Software Engineering FSS24)

## Requirements Specification

The **requirements specification** can always be found in [REQUIREMENTS_SPECIFICATION.md](REQUIREMENTS_SPECIFICATION.md).

## Project

A Spring Boot project with integrated webserver.

### Run

Execute CtfApplication.java in Code or open the server.jar from root the following way:  
```bash
java -jar server.jar
```
The server is also automatically started by our [UI](https://github.com/sephdoto/CaptureTheFlag) on startup, so the jar does not need to be executed.  

### Integrated Webservice

Configuration (e.g., port) is located in [application.properties](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2Fapplication.properties).
